        <h2> Why I like videogames.</h2>

        <p>I love to play videogames. I like to spend most of my free time playing them.I play games entirely on my PC and online. My favorite genres are role-playing games(RPGs), first-person shooters(FPS), and strategy games. I like playing them because they give me an entertaining challenge and they allow you to experience stories in a unique way. I often go to a website called <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> to get news about games and to talk about them on the forum there.</p>

            <h3> I don't know what I'd do without videogames</h3>
            <p>I've never been much for sports and I'm not really a people person so I was draw to videogames at a early age. It certainly gives me something to do and playing multiplayer games helps fill the gap in my socializing.</p>

            <h3> My prefered gaming system is the PC</h3>
            <img src="images/computer.jpg.png" height="150" alt="Standard PC">
            <p>I've been playing games exclusively on the PC for many years now. I think it really started when I got into World of Warcraft and after that I just gravitated toward more PC games. I think being able to simply buy and download games also held an appeal as it meant I wouldn't have to go to stores and could avoid human contact even more than I already did.</p>
