        <h2> Why I like videogames.</h2>

        <p>I love playing videogames. I like to spend most of my free time playing them.I play games entirely on my PC and online. My favorite genres are role-playing games(RPGs), first-person shooters(FPS), and strategy games. I like playing them because they give me an entertaining challenge and they allow you to experience stories in a unique way. I often go to a website called <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> to get news about games and to talk about them on the forum there.</p>
